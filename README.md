# PathPlanningBar-AI1Assignment1
In Japan, a few coffee shops are using robots as waiters and baristas. However, as the number of customers increases, the shops realise that they need to efficiently and effectively plan the way in which robots perform their tasks, to properly run the shop.
In this paper, we analysed the efficiency of our PDDL planning model, which has the task of managing the movements and actions of a waiter robot and a barista robot running a coffee shop. The model is performed with ENHSP Planning System (version: ENHSP-20), using different engines, due to the limits of ENHSP. The environment is defined and the robots have limits and specific rules to comply with in order to perform and satisfy customersâ€™ needs.
